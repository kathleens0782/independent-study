<h1><u>Entry 2: A-B-A Format and makeBeat()</u></h1>
<p>Continuing on my journey with learning Earsketch, I decided to check out more of the tutorials.</p>
<p>Upon reading and practicing these tutorials more, I learned something called an A-B-A format.</p>
<p>This is a skill used when making songs, where you set up a beat, add a variation in the second part, and play the first beat again.</p>
<p>Another thing I started learning was makeBeat(), or any function that can be used to make short, drum-like beats.</p>

<h3><u>Command Notes ♪♫♬</u></h3>
<p>Some things I learned:</p>
<li><b>makeBeat():</b> Makes beat-by-beat notes instead of measure-by-measure beats.</li>
<li><b>Strings:</b> The strings in makeBeat are the beats themselves</li>
<ul>"0" plays a clip</ul>
<ul>"+" extends an audio clip</ul>
<ul>"-" signifies a rest</ul>
<hr></hr>
<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
<p>I think my next steps is to continue learning functions that will help me understand making songs. I would also like to start learning how to produce and use SFX, or sound effects in the future. As for what project I plan to make with this, I'm still wondering what genre I want to me.</p>
