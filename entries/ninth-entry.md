### Entry 9: The End
---

In these past nine weeks, I felt like I learned a lot. I learned a new programming language, looked up and did tutorials in my own time. And now, I feel like I can even teach this program to other people who may be interested in code.

I had a lot of fun with this program, considering that I plan to go in a small possible career with music. Making music was always a small hobby of mine, but combining that small hobby with code was an experience I feel like I'll never forget.

Overall, this unit in general -- Independent Study -- has been one of my favorite units, up there with Processing and Web Design.

If I had to improve this project in anyway, I'd do the following; making the song longer, adding more SFX, making more interesting transitions, fix up the intro, etc. Afterall, no one project should ever have no room for improvement. There's always something to improve on, even if the project in question is perfect.
