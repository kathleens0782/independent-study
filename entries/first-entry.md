<h1><u>Entry 1: Introduction to Earsketch</u></h1>
<p></p>
<p>So, I know what you're thinking:</p>
<p>What the heck is Earsketch?</p>
<p>So far, it's like a magical combination of Python and GarageBand. You can make songs n' stuff with it!</p>
<p>Earsketch either teaches users how to use Python or Javascript via making and composing songs, or vice versa, with programmers using their knowledge of the two programs to make and compose songs.</p>
<p>I picked this one for two reasons; one- I'm technically a musician, and two- I've had my friends suggest me this program as my Independent Study topic.</p>

<h3><u>Command Notes ♪♫♬</u></h3>
<p>So far, I've learned these commands:</p>
<li><b>init():</b> Basically the start of the code.</li>
<li><b>setTempo():</b> Sets the tempo (note: tempo is how fast or slow a song plays) up for a song (ex: <small>setTempo(120), setTempo(60), setTempo(180), etc.</small>)</li>
<li><b>fitMedia():</b> The sample that plays, the track number, the starting measure, and the ending measure (ex: <small>fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_1, 1, 1, 5))</small></li>
<li><b>finish():</b> The end of the code.</li>

<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
<p>With a program that's really intriguing me so far, I'm currently thinking about making a song of my own with this. I haven't thought of what genre yet, but I think the song could be 3-5 minutes in length. Eitherway, I look forward to making something amazing with this program!</p>
