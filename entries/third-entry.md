<h1><u>Entry 3: Continuing makeBeat() and Learning Loops</u></h1>
<p>This week, I tried something a little different. I went back to some of the tutorials for more practice.</p>
<p>And I'm glad I did.</p>
<p>Not only did I keep commands fresh in my mind, but it turns out that I've been forgetting to read up on a couple of things. The main thing was that the function `makeBeat()` had a lot more to it then just making "beat-by-beat notes."</p>
<p>Along with that, I also started to learn about looping, and how it works in Earsketch (which isn't all that different from any other program with a looping function).</p>

<h3><u>Command Notes ♪♫♬</u></h3>
<p>Some things I learned:</p>
<li><b>`makeBeat()`:</b> while you can establish beat-by-beat patterns with this function, you can do other things with it too. This is a custom function that you can add any string or variable to.</li>
<li><b>`for measure in range`:</b> the "for loop" in Earsketch, or a piece of code that executes a loop (aka: looping a sound clip to a section of a song).</li>
<ul></ul>

<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
<p>One thing I learned from this week is to always redo tutorials when learning something new. You never know if you might've forgotten something or learn something that you missed before. </p>
